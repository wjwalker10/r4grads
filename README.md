### Part of MOLB5700 - Fundamental Skills for Biomedical Researchers

### [Vikram E. Chhatre](https://vc.popgen.org), Braveen Joseph & Samuel Fay

## Schedule
- Module 1: February 17
- Module 2: February 24
- Module 3: March 3


## 1. How do I prepare for the modules?

1. Get a free [GitHub account](https://github.com). Once you
login to your account, navigate to [this
repository](https://github.com/wyoibc/r4grads) and click on ``Watch`` button in
the top right corner. This will help you keep track of changes being made
upstream. I will update the repository periodically.

2. Install Git, the version control system on your computer

	- Mac OSX has a git client built into it. So no installation is
	  necessary.
	
	- If you use a Windows computer, install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

3. Download and install latest versions of R and RStudio

	- R can be downloaded from [r-project.org](https://r-project.org)

	- RStudio can be obtained from [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)


4. Make sure your ``git`` installation works.

	- Mac OSX: Open Terminal.app, and type ``git --version``. This should
	  print git version to the screen. If you get an error message, contact
me (vchhatre at uwyo.edu).

	- Git for Windows: Right click on desktop and choose ``Git Bash``,
	  which should open up a terminal window. If you run into issues, make
sure you followed instructions on their website (see above).


5. Request access to the [class Slack
account](https://join.slack.com/t/r4grads/shared_invite/zt-licfgnic-caJdAqZHi~kVHD5dPGCiag).
When the class is in session, we will provide live help on this Slack channel.
